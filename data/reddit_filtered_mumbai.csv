I've exposed many clubs but this one seems to be the baap of all

Nothing less than 10 targets daily 

Many people have filed cyber complaints, called cops on spot, told these girls they'll be exposed but it continues

How are u still listing them @zomato despite such reviews ?

Exactly same stories posted by hundreds of men but @MumbaiPolice @CPMumbaiPolice seem to be snoozing

These aren't men scamming men in guise of a woman online. These are real women confidently scamming a guy every single day. Some guys did try to report them but then the woman card & they got scared !!! 

MUMBAI : Plz tag folks from CM office who can help

PLEASE SHARE üôèüôè

This scammer club has got people to post fake reviews after people started calling them out

Drop a review so that more people become aware : The Godfather Club & Lounge g.co/kgs/ygZ1CJd

You can remind them of their deeds on Instagram too : instagram.com/tgf_mumbai?igs‚Ä¶


Happening right under Bandra Police nose but they don't care to investigate even after formal complaints lodged by victims last time I exposed other club

@TOIMumbai @Khanmidday

Formal complaints lodged online. 

Are cyber complaints taken so that they hibernate in the systems @MumbaiPolice ? Does it not look like an organized crime to you or should we believe that you have some special interest in protecting these scammers ?

Reddit_Post,"Title: Someone sent me a cake with ""Farewell"" written on it.. Body: So today my watchman comes and says you have a delivery from zomato.
And I see it's a cake from Merwans and it has ""Farewell"" written on it.

Firstly, there's no reason to have a Farewell cake.
Secondly I asked all my friends and colleagues if they sent it as a prank and they've all denied.


I'm shit scared rn because why would someone send a ""Farewell"" cake. 

On top of that the delivery boy handed the phone to the watchman and a lady spoke to him and told my dad's name and flat number.

Dad has no clue who could it be and why was his name used in the address.

I was home alone when I received the cake.


Am I just being paranoid or should I report this incident ?

Update 1 : As of 9:00 A.M. my mom threw the cake. I contacted the app they want the order ID which I can't produce cos I didn't place the order lol.
Mom also is asking not to go to police cos she doesn't want any other issues.
Will just be vigilant and maybe keep in constant contact with parents whenever they're out.

And I've uploaded the cake photo in one of the comments in case it's not visible pls tell me.
The reason it has cuts is because we checked to see if anything was put inside the cake. 


Update 2 : 6:50 P.M.

It's been 24 hours since I received the cake lol.

But I haven't received any updates from who sent the cake and zomato also hasn't replied to my DM. 

 I'm overthinking this and will try to forget  this incident.
Thanks to everyone who commented and wished for my safety.

If any updates I'll add here. 

Update 3 : No reply from zomato. Nobody messaged or call regarding the cake. Will just bury this for now.
Thanks to everyone for their suggestions/concern.

Reddit_Comment,"There are a few reasons Zomato introduced Gold: 

1. To stick you to one platform, theirs
2. To prevent restaurants from delivering directly to you as they would find it difficult to deliver for free but that's a smaller reason

They literally sold it for 1 to 3 rs even 9 rs to move people from Swiggy. 

However, they messed up on the who will pay for deliveries? 
So they are trying a few solutions. 
1. Start a platform fee. And keep pushing customers till they can take it
2. They reduced Distance for Gold to 7 km
3. They have started charging restaurants now to deliver beyond orders of 4+ km. That will get deployed soon. You'll start seeing your favourite restaurants not possible to deliver soon. Charge is 35 rs per order
4. They have started manipulating distances to more than 7 km of your favourite restaurants.

Reddit_Comment,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. 

It‚Äôs the restaurant that sets prices on Swiggy ? Restaurants surges the price so as not to be underpaid with Swiggy‚Äôs discounts. If they have 50% of mrp on the menu in the restaurant, they will have very little profit post discounts. Compared to when they sell in store it comes entirely in their pockets. 

If you see chain restaurants, like mcd, subway, good flippin burgers etc; it‚Äôs cheaper to order online. The prices are same online as they are in store, so you get discount on the base price itself. 

Dominos sells their classic style pizza at 99 on Swiggy I think, on Zomato and in stores it‚Äôs 49, Swiggy usually has ‚Äúoffers‚Äù on dominos.  

Now coming to packaging, I think that‚Äô should be included in the item and not be charged separately. Delivery is just convenience tax at this point.

I don't think dabbawalas can pivot to Swiggy/Zomato style home deliveries, however they can learn a lot from the dabbawalas and implement some ideas to improve their own operations. At the moment they use the direct point to point model, where one delivery boy goes to the restaurant, picks up your food and delivers straight to your home. This is extremely inefficient because this whole operation of 20-40 minutes results in one man delivering one parcel. Even when you order from quite far away, like from Bandra to Versova, it's the same thing.

Maybe a delivery agent can talk more about this, and let us know how many parcels they deliver during their whole shift.¬†",mumbai,,https://reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1lbwenm/can_mumbai_dabbawalas_beat_swiggy_and_zomato_in/mxwxslv/,Rajagosavi,138,18,0.91,FuckPigeons2025,102.0,"['extremely', 'different', 'business', 'dabbawalas', 'dont', 'cater', 'instant', 'demand', 'subscribe', 'long', 'term', 'fixed', 'pickup', 'delivery', 'location', 'due', 'extremely', 'optimised', 'operation', 'based', 'hub', 'spoke', 'model', 'dont', 'think', 'dabbawalas', 'pivot', 'swiggyzomato', 'style', 'home', 'delivery', 'however', 'learn', 'lot', 'dabbawalas', 'implement', 'idea', 'improve', 'operation', 'moment', 'use', 'direct', 'point', 'point', 'model', 'one', 'delivery', 'boy', 'go', 'restaurant', 'pick', 'food', 'delivers', 'straight', 'home', 'extremely', 'inefficient', 'whole', 'operation', 'minute', 'result', 'one', 'man', 'delivering', 'one', 'parcel', 'even', 'order', 'quite', 'far', 'away', 'like', 'bandra', 'versova', 'thing', 'maybe', 'delivery', 'agent', 'talk', 'let', 'u', 'know', 'many', 'parcel', 'deliver', 'whole', 'shift']"

Reddit_Post,"Title: Zomato Review Scam. Body: Off late I have noticed multiple instances where a restaurant or cafe or bar will have near  perfect ratings on Zomato.
When you actually visit the place, it‚Äôs terrible. The food is blah, drinks are watered down, the service sucks, staff is rude and the prices are high.

A deep dive into the review reveal a scam of sorts going on. 
There‚Äôs a massive and sudden influx of 5* reviews. The reviews are all the same. I mean they are identical, so it‚Äôs not the same sentence pasted multiple times. But the language or the general opinion posted is always the same.
They talk about two things in particular 

1. ‚ÄúAmbience‚Äù (I hate that this word is common parlance now, if everything has great ambience, nothing has great ambience)
Review will carry some variation of  ‚Äúgreat ambience‚Äù

2. ‚ÄúService‚Äù again, mostly all 5 üåü reviews will mention some variation of ‚ÄúMr/Ms X gave good service‚Äù

Nothing about the food or drinks is ever mentioned. No specifics about what was ordered, the quantity, quality, value for money. Nothing.

And there‚Äôs a plethora of these reviews for very top rated place.

Second level dive, so with the inquisitive mind I and free time I have, I dug a little deeper.
I checked the profile of these reviewers on Zomato. And they have reviewed random places at random locations. And all the reviews follow the same template.

Most folks don't bother looking into the authenticity of reviews posted about a specific product or service on the internet, their mind is already made up when they see high ratings.

All of this is after making me wait for 15 mins already. In the end all he promised was to look into it with his accounts team and get back to me without any other solution being provided.

However, charging GST on Service Charge is correct. The service charge is levied by the restaurant for the service provided and hence it is liable to pay GST on it.

Reddit_Comment,"I've been living alone as well for past few months and I tried cooking myself and have settled to it..I order occasionally from outside.

There's pretty decent outlets which serve salad these days (available on Swiggy). These are not boring raw salad but quite varied and interesting, do try them. 

Btw, I would imagine that Sandwizza ( Santa Cruz) services Andheri, I love their sandwiches and I'm sure you'll like them too.

Lastly I would suggest you figure a way to cook. For example, you could make a sabji on Sunday and keep it in the fridge and try ordering just chapati from outside during weekdays. Interestingly, the other day as I finished a long client meeting and was walking down to the main road I saw a road side stall making hot and fresh chapatis and I bought some takeaway. I just made sabji at home. 

And one more thing. Not sure you like South Indian. It's very easy and quick to make rasam. You could make Rasam on Sunday and for the next few days just keep rice as soon as you get home from work. You can cook boiled potato sabji South Indian style and that hardly takes time and yet tastes amazing..!!",mumbai,,https://reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1gchwgt/hey_i_have_recently_moved_to_mumbai_and_i_am/ltuz3mr/,pakkykk,15,60,0.86,Solid_Story9420,5.0,"['ive', 'living', 'alone', 'well', 'past', 'month', 'tried', 'cooking', 'settled', 'iti', 'order', 'occasionally', 'outside', 'there', 'pretty', 'decent', 'outlet', 'serve', 'salad', 'day', 'available', 'swiggy', 'boring', 'raw', 'salad', 'quite', 'varied', 'interesting', 'try', 'btw', 'would', 'imagine', 'sandwizza', 'santa', 'cruz', 'service', 'andheri', 'love', 'sandwich', 'im', 'sure', 'youll', 'like', 'lastly', 'would', 'suggest', 'figure', 'way', 'cook', 'example', 'could', 'make', 'sabji', 'sunday', 'keep', 'fridge', 'try', 'ordering', 'chapati', 'outside', 'weekday', 'interestingly', 'day', 'finished', 'long', 'client', 'meeting', 'walking', 'main', 'road', 'saw', 'road', 'side', 'stall', 'making', 'hot', 'fresh', 'chapati', 'bought', 'takeaway', 'made', 'sabji', 'home', 'one', 'thing', 'sure', 'like', 'south', 'indian', 'easy', 'quick', 'make', 'rasam', 'could', 'make', 'rasam', 'sunday', 'next', 'day', 'keep', 'rice', 'soon', 'get', 'home', 'work', 'cook', 'boiled', 'potato', 'sabji', 'south', 'indian', 'style', 'hardly', 'take', 'time', 'yet', 'taste', 'amazing']"
Reddit_Comment,"Hello fellow working Andhera. Been there done that. Here is what I did.

1. Create a list of 2-3 vegetarian or non-vegetarian mains that can be cooked and kept for 5 days.
2. Speak with neighbour or security guard to connect you with a cook or maharaj.
3. Negotiate with candidates to come once a week and cook, mains + carbs (rice or roti). Cut your own kachumber salad.
4. Buy Tupperware or similar containers, preferably glass with airlock lids (500 ml ideal). Buy per the number of meals you want to save: 1 or 2 meals x no. of days.
5. Cook the meals in advance on a Sunday, and deep freeze. Microwave each portion before eating.

Reddit_Post,"Title: (PSA) My experience with Food Darzee (very bad). Body: I'm normally just a lurker here but I'm hoping enough people see this, so that people considering using Food Darzee's meal plan services can reconsider. 

I've been staying alone at home for the last 14 days. Since I'm working, I don't have the time to go to the market and buy fresh ingredients, so I decided to go with Food Darzee's meal plan. I'd used their services many years ago and I'd really loved it then, so I assumed it would be pretty much the same.

While booking a plan, I was asked to choose from low carb, balanced meal, keto and 1-2 other diet options. I went with low carb because I wanted to lose weight anyways, and to my surprise, I couldn't see or choose the food items that would be on my menu.

I'm currently already seeing a dietician, so I didn't really need the services of the nutritionist they provide. I said this when the nutritionist called me too, but she just kept repeating ""okay sir, but we'll provide a nutritionist for you."" I gave up and said fine.

Turns out, they have an app where if you go into the menu section, one by one manually you have to go through the days and change the meal item for whichever meals you've chosen. I chose breakfast, lunch and dinner, so I sat and manually changed a week's worth of 3 meals a day, which is painfully long. Not only that, there's essentially 2 options they give, one Indian and one non Indian, and only variations in that. For example, some gravy with paneer/tofu/veggies/chicken. And many of these aren't even low carb meals - so what's the point of making me choose when I sign up?

They also changed items I'd chosen without informing me. I asked them again and again to tell me if they're changing items, and the nutritionist said it's because of the calories count. Then why did you give me the option to choose those items in the first place? Did you not plan properly and then give menu options?

Additionally, they put boiled carrots, peas and cauliflower in almost every meal, whether Indian or not. So there have been many days where I've eaten pesto spaghetti with boiled carrots and peas mixed in. I asked them to discontinue carrots and they did, but not without fighting about the calories count (again).

They don't have proper communication with the logistics partner's either. The delivery person they've assigned to me comes almost at the start of the 8 am to 10 am slot they've assigned for deliveries. Till today, in the last 14 days, I can count on one hand how many times he's given me the food in my hands. Almost always, he rings the bell and leaves the food outside my door and leaves. It's still happening, even after I raised the issue with the company and they acknowledged it. Idk if he's in a rush to get back into the lift or what, but why would you just leave food items outside someone's door without checking if they've got it? Even Swiggy and Zomato don't do that.

And then the delivery person randomly decides not to show up to pick up my food from the company. I find out about this an hour before I have to leave for work, which means I have to sit at home until the last possible minute to see if he comes. The alternate delivery person didn't arrive by the time I had to leave, so I informed the nutritionist and asked for that day's food to not be sent, and she agreed. When I went down to my gate, the delivery person was there and was going upstairs. I told his partner to call him back as I was going out, the food would be lying there outside for 6-8 hours and he then did so.

Overall, it's been a pretty basic experience. What I remember of Food Darzee's service from years ago is completely gone. I'd recommend everyone reading this post to NOT use their services, try looking for another one if you need meal plans (and please recommend some if you know and trust any others).

TL;DR: Food Darzee promises one thing and does the exact opposite. You have very little choice of what food you get and they have little to no communication with the logistics partner. You're better off looking for another meal plan company.",mumbai,,https://www.reddit.com/r/mumbai/comments/1faybf7/psa_my_experience_with_food_darzee_very_bad/,undead-inside,13,13,1.0,,,"['psa', 'experience', 'food', 'darzee', 'bad', 'im', 'normally', 'lurker', 'im', 'hoping', 'enough', 'people', 'see', 'people', 'considering', 'using', 'food', 'darzees', 'meal', 'plan', 'service', 'reconsider', 'ive', 'staying', 'alone', 'home', 'last', 'day', 'since', 'im', 'working', 'dont', 'time', 'go', 'market', 'buy', 'fresh', 'ingredient', 'decided', 'go', 'food', 'darzees', 'meal', 'plan', 'id', 'used', 'service', 'many', 'year', 'ago', 'id', 'really', 'loved', 'assumed', 'would', 'pretty', 'much', 'booking', 'plan', 'asked', 'choose', 'low', 'carb', 'balanced', 'meal', 'keto', 'diet', 'option', 'went', 'low', 'carb', 'wanted', 'lose', 'weight', 'anyways', 'surprise', 'couldnt', 'see', 'choose', 'food', 'item', 'would', 'menu', 'im', 'currently', 'already', 'seeing', 'dietician', 'didnt', 'really', 'need', 'service', 'nutritionist', 'provide', 'said', 'nutritionist', 'called', 'kept', 'repeating', 'okay', 'sir', 'well', 'provide', 'nutritionist', 'gave', 'said', 'fine', 'turn', 'app', 'go', 'menu', 'section', 'one', 'one', 'manually', 'go', 'day', 'change', 'meal', 'item', 'whichever', 'meal', 'youve', 'chosen', 'chose', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'sat', 'manually', 'changed', 'week', 'worth', 'meal', 'day', 'painfully', 'long', 'there', 'essentially', 'option', 'give', 'one', 'indian', 'one', 'non', 'indian', 'variation', 'example', 'gravy', 'paneertofuveggieschicken', 'many', 'arent', 'even', 'low', 'carb', 'meal', 'whats', 'point', 'making', 'choose', 'sign', 'also', 'changed', 'item', 'id', 'chosen', 'without', 'informing', 'asked', 'tell', 'theyre', 'changing', 'item', 'nutritionist', 'said', 'calorie', 'count', 'give', 'option', 'choose', 'item', 'first', 'place', 'plan', 'properly', 'give', 'menu', 'option', 'additionally', 'put', 'boiled', 'carrot', 'pea', 'cauliflower', 'almost', 'every', 'meal', 'whether', 'indian', 'many', 'day', 'ive', 'eaten', 'pesto', 'spaghetti', 'boiled', 'carrot', 'pea', 'mixed', 'asked', 'discontinue', 'carrot', 'without', 'fighting', 'calorie', 'count', 'dont', 'proper', 'communication', 'logistics', 'partner', 'either', 'delivery', 'person', 'theyve', 'assigned', 'come', 'almost', 'start', 'slot', 'theyve', 'assigned', 'delivery', 'till', 'today', 'last', 'day', 'count', 'one', 'hand', 'many', 'time', 'he', 'given', 'food', 'hand', 'almost', 'always', 'ring', 'bell', 'leaf', 'food', 'outside', 'door', 'leaf', 'still', 'happening', 'even', 'raised', 'issue', 'company', 'acknowledged', 'idk', 'he', 'rush', 'get', 'back', 'lift', 'would', 'leave', 'food', 'item', 'outside', 'someone', 'door', 'without', 'checking', 'theyve', 'got', 'even', 'swiggy', 'dont', 'delivery', 'person', 'randomly', 'decides', 'show', 'pick', 'food', 'company', 'find', 'hour', 'leave', 'work', 'mean', 'sit', 'home', 'last', 'possible', 'minute', 'see', 'come', 'alternate', 'delivery', 'person', 'didnt', 'arrive', 'time', 'leave', 'informed', 'nutritionist', 'asked', 'day', 'food', 'sent', 'agreed', 'went', 'gate', 'delivery', 'person', 'going', 'upstairs', 'told', 'partner', 'call', 'back', 'going', 'food', 'would', 'lying', 'outside', 'hour', 'overall', 'pretty', 'basic', 'experience', 'remember', 'food', 'darzees', 'service', 'year', 'ago', 'completely', 'gone', 'id', 'recommend', 'everyone', 'reading', 'post', 'use', 'service', 'try', 'looking', 'another', 'one', 'need', 'meal', 'plan', 'please', 'recommend', 'know', 'trust', 'others', 'tldr', 'food', 'darzee', 'promise', 'one', 'thing', 'exact', 'opposite', 'little', 'choice', 'food', 'get', 'little', 'communication', 'logistics', 'partner', 'youre', 'better', 'looking', 'another', 'meal', 'plan', 'company']"

Terrible - Pathetic is an understatement.


Have been their customer when they had started and used them for a year on and off.


Big mistake to come back to these guys.


1. Sending food - Incomplete. Pav Bhaji without Pao. Amazing!
2. Food spillage.
3. Sending low carb food? I got full grain rice in one of meals! Unless your company thinks that Keto is full grain rice now.
4. 50% of the food is absolutely -
TASTELESS!
5. Food has been stale and infact stinky.
6. App is crap. It doesnt follow anything. Initially on deposit it will say prepay for the month and get 1k credit. You will never get it. Not like you will use it anyway.


Sent a whatsapp message to Mr. DEVAJ [CO-FOUNDER] - told him all this and all he had to say is Sorry for the inconvenience.


Told them that I know refund wont come, so I told them to keep the 15 day subscription that is left.


Devaj said Sorry.


Anyway, If I am able to deter even 1 new person going to them, I will deem this message as successful.

I mean eat fresh vegetables and fruits such as apples, orange, watermelon, banana, grapes, papaya, kiwi, etc. Not all vegetables can be eaten raw so get the ones that can be eaten as salads such as carrot, cucumber, beetroot, tomatoes, onions, capsicum, broccoli, lettuce leaves, celery, etc. These veggies provide the daily nourishment needed by the body besides keeping good gut health.

Also start having dairy products such as milk and yoghurt which is good for gut health as well. You can also buy dry fruits such as almonds, pistachios, walnut, pumpkin seeds, dry figs, and dates. You can consume them when you feel like snacking which is a good healthy option. Plus you can buy and keep a crate of eggs so you can have it for breakfast as boiled/omlette/scrambled egg.
